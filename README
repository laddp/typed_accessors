This rails plugin creates a set of typed accessors for data types.
This is very handy when you are interacting with a service that
returns strings and you want them automatically turned into more
useful types.

Ex:

  class Foo
    float_accessor :float
    date_accessor :date
  end

  >> f = Foo.new
  => #<Foo:0xb7a3dd44>
  >> f.float = "1.4"
  => "1.4"
  >> f.float
  => 1.4
  >> f.float = "1"
  => "1"
  >> f.float
  => 1.0
  >> f.date = "2009-10-30"
  => "2009-10-30"
  >> f.date
  => #<Date: 4910269/2,0,2299161>
  >> f.date.to_s
  => "2009-10-30"
